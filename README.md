# R Statistics
**Statistics with R**

This is my repo for all notebooks that I use on Statisics study using R

I will be using [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com)

since [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is not supporting R

Here is [My Library](https://notebooks.azure.com/daddyawesome/projects/Rstudies)


## EDIT Since AZURE NOTEBOOK is Decommisioned
I will use binder
